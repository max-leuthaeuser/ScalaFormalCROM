===============

**1. Description:**
This is an adaption for Scala of [formalCROM][formalCROM].

**2. Edit and run:**

2.1. Clone this repo.

2.2. You may want to use SBT and run ```gen-idea``` if you are using Intellij IDE <= 13 (to config see [here][sbt-gen-idea]). This is not required anymore since Intellij 14. Just use the built-in import SBT project functionality.
